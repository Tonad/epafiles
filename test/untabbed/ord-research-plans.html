   <h3>Multi-Year Plans</h3>
   <p>EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) has a strategic multi-year planning process to guide the direction of its research over five or more years. This approach enables ORD to focus on EPA's highest priority needs for science and promotes coordination of research across its laboratories and centers to achieve research goals.  ORD's research program is planned in collaboration with EPA's program and regional offices, and  is described in Multi-Year Plans (MYPs).</p>
	<p>MYPs identify long-term research goals and outline annual performance goals (APGs) and associated annual performance measures (APMs). The purpose of the plans is to:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>Provide an overview of the direction of the research</li>
			<li>Present significant research accomplishments</li>
			<li>Communicate ORD's research program </li>
	</ul>
			
	<p>MYPs are intended to be living documents and are updated as needed to reflect the current state of the science; input from clients, stakeholders, and advisory groups, resource availability; and Agency priorities.</p>
	<a name="ca" id="ca"></a>
	<h4>Clean Air Research Plan</h4>
	<p>The Clean Air Research Program in ORD provides the science and develops the tools to support the Agency's statutory responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.  The program provides the scientific foundation to develop regulations and advanced tools and models to implement the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by states, regions and tribes.  The program also strives to develop better ways to track progress in achieving health and environmental improvements under EPA's goal for clean air. </p>
	<p>The multi-year plan for Clean Air Research defines the research needed by regulatory decision-makers to protect the public health from air pollutants.  A primary research focus is on particulate matter (PM) and ozone as high risk pollutants.  Research is also conducted to advance scientific understanding of hazardous air pollutants.  The research program is moving toward a multi-pollutant approach to the assessment of air pollution. Such an approach better reflects the complexity of real-world air pollution problems and parallels evolving scientific and regulatory considerations.</p>

	<h4>Human Health Risk Assessment Plan</h4>
	<p>The Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) program supports effective and informed decision making required by several legislative acts including the Food Quality Protection Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Clean Air Act and supports the risk assessment needs of EPA, states and other government organizations. The HHRA is one of the Agency's highest priority programs with peer-reviewed products used extensively by EPA programs, regional offices, and other parties to determine the potential risk to public health from exposure to environmental contaminants, develop regulatory standards, and manage environmental cleanups.</p>
	<p>The HHRA program incorporates, integrates, and coordinates the use of scientific information to directly respond to regulatory decision-making.  The MYP describes the ongoing and planned activities to develop state-of-the-art health risk assessment methods and models and generate hazard and dose-response assessments. Research products that have supported EPA's decision making include the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) assessments, Integrated Science Assessments (ISA) for major air pollutants, and other assessments (e.g., World Trade Center).  The HHRA program is at the forefront of applying quantitative methods to advance risk assessment to reduce uncertainty in risk extrapolations and to replace default uncertainty factors and conducts scientific evaluations to support critical risk assessment products such as the EPA 2005 Cancer Guidelines and Early-Life Supplemental Guidance.</p>

README.txt

The PSD files are re-saves from the original Fireworks files, with the layers reconstucted by Jeff M, November 2009.

In addition to the graphics, the PSD files are annoted to describe:

- the legacy "Web Layers" from the Fireworks version but are not actual "usemap" data points

- the names of the Regions or states as graphics only.
